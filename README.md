1) Owner of the NFT approves all NFTâ€™s to the Marketplace
2) Owner of the NFT signs to create an off-chain auction listing with a minimum price
3) Bidder approves ERC20 tokens to Marketplace
4) Bidder signs a bid for the auction
5) If owner approves the bid, signs it back and retrieve to bidder
6) Anyone with both signatures can settle the transaction
7) The owner takes the ERC20 whilst the bidder takes the NFT.
